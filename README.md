# WriteToSanta
This react app allows parents to receive Christmas lists, with associated Amazon 
links to each gift, directly from their children via email. The user adds to their 
"Santa List" by inputting the name of the gift under “title” and its description(optional) 
where stated. After the user is finished with their list, they will put in the desired email 
address to whom they want to send the list to. The email will contain the title, description,
and amazon link to each gift. This app brings a whole new meaning to convenience for 
parents/guardians who want to get a head start on shopping for the Holiday Season. 
Happy Holidays and Enjoy!
